# Landing-Page
TOP Project - Landing Page

Goal:
  The goal of this project was to create a website from scratch to look somewhat simular to this link provided at the bottom. I feel as this small project showed me some
challenges that were easy to layout but at the same time hard to put together. It was like knowing what ingredients make up a cake without actually doing the process to
prepare, mix, and bake the cake.

Challenges:
  The only challenge for me was how to use multiple flex boxes together to fit all the items on the page in the correct order. Which also means I needed to be more 
 distinct with my wording for my div classes. In turn, being more clear in wording leads to less backtracking in my CSS page. Next, to put multiple flex boxes together
 took some time to really play with the styling and get more understanding of why this line of code works and this one does not. Overall, this challenge gave be a 
 better grasp of each coding line that followed.
